NOTE	---->


CSE		---->

	BUGFIX			=
		> Cell use list is broken
			> Forms instantiated with our custom serializers don't correctly update the cell count leading to negative values
			> Deleting a ref from the render window doesn't update its baseform's cell use counts (vanilla bug)
		> Dirty edits?
			>> http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1517431-rel-construction-set-extender/?p=25301452
		> Object window columns like Auto calc, Enchantment type, Count don't sort consistently
			>> Columns not handled by default = 3, 24, 41, 54. Some others are incorrectly handled


	ENHANCEMENT		=
		> Tag editor
			> Save/cluster tags by parent plugins; load appropriately when parent plugin in loaded
		> Serialization enhancements:
			> Save parent plugin data to disk
		> Reimplement the hide active/deleted forms tool
		> Add support for filtering strings in all form list subitems
		> OSD enhancements
			> Render window gizmos
				> Imguizmo has issues with the CS' renderer (view matrix related) (ask Nukem)

		> Add support for TOD/sunlight lighting in exteriors
			> Currently only works with interiors that behave like exteriors
				>> Seems likely that the issue is dependent on modifying the fragment shaders used for lighting in exteriors
		> Double click on formIds/editorIds in the console
		> Wildcard find/replace
		> Add an option to restore a saved backup for some esp/esm, instead of manually recover it from Data/Backup folder and moving it back to Data folder.

		> Show Target NPCs context menu tool
			>> Would it be possible to have the option to view the list of NPCs, a sort of Use Info option just for NPCs who meet the conditions for speaking a response?
		> Copy From Template tool
			>> Batch editor for base forms
		> Add a random "roughness" factor to the landscape sculpting brush
		> Overhaul of the Region Editor, with a larger (adjustable?) window, a larger rendering area and greater control of node placement and repositioning.

	ENHANCEMENT		=
		> Use ObjectListView in the LineTrackingManager
		> Prevent the creation of duplicate script editor IDs
		> Fuzzy search for IntelliSense
